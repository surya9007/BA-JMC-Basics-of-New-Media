# Communication Technology and Society

## ✅ Introduction

Communication technology refers to the tools, systems, and methods used to transmit information from one place to another, connecting people across vast distances in real time or asynchronously. These technologies have dramatically reshaped societies by transforming how individuals, businesses, governments, and communities interact, share knowledge, conduct commerce, and influence cultural and political landscapes.

From traditional postal services to telegraphs, telephones, radio, television, mobile networks, the internet, and emerging technologies like AI and blockchain, communication tools have expanded human interaction beyond physical boundaries. Today’s society relies heavily on digital networks and platforms, which are embedded into almost every facet of life.
