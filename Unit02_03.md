# Cyber Crimes and Cyber Security: An Overview

## Introduction
With the rise of the **internet, social media, digital journalism, and e-commerce**, cyberspace has become an inseparable part of daily life.  
But this dependency also creates **vulnerabilities**. Criminals exploit these vulnerabilities through **cyber crimes**, while **cyber security** aims to defend systems, networks, and data.  

In the context of **New Media**, understanding cyber threats is vital for journalists, media houses, and online platforms that deal with sensitive information, public communication, and digital credibility.

## Evolution of Cyber Crimes
1. **Early Phase (1980s–1990s):**  
   - Basic hacking, virus creation, and email fraud.  
   - First known cybercrime convictions (e.g., Morris Worm in 1988).  

2. **Internet Boom (2000s):**  
   - Rise in phishing, identity theft, online banking fraud.  
   - Organized cybercrime groups emerged.  

3. **Digital Age (2010s–Present):**  
   - Ransomware, cyber terrorism, state-sponsored cyber warfare.  
   - Advanced persistent threats (APT) and large-scale data breaches (e.g., Yahoo, Facebook, Aadhaar leaks).

## Cyber Security

### Definition
Cyber security is the collective set of strategies, tools, and practices to protect **digital devices, communication systems, and data** from cyber threats.

### Core Principles (CIA Triad)
- **Confidentiality:** Restrict unauthorized access.  
- **Integrity:** Maintain accuracy and reliability of data.  
- **Availability:** Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed.  

### Major Domains of Cyber Security
1. **Network Security** – Firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection systems.  
2. **Application Security** – Secure coding, software patching, penetration testing.  
3. **Cloud Security** – Protecting online data storage and services.  
4. **Information Security** – Encryption, access control, data masking.  
5. **Operational Security** – Defining user privileges, policies, and monitoring.  
6. **Endpoint Security** – Antivirus, device protection, multi-factor authentication.  
7. **Disaster Recovery & Continuity** – Backup and response planning.  
8. **User Awareness & Training** – Educating individuals to avoid traps.
