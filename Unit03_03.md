## **1. Introduction to Convergence**

**Convergence** refers to the process through which distinct technologies, industries, or media forms merge to create new modes of communication, interaction, and service delivery. It represents the blending of computing, communication, and content technologies, resulting in a unified and interactive environment.

In the field of **New Media**, convergence is one of the most significant developments. It has brought together various forms of media—such as print, broadcast, and digital—into one interconnected ecosystem. This integration allows users to **access, share, and interact** with content across multiple platforms.

### **Definition**
> “Convergence is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, and communication networks that have emerged as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet.”
