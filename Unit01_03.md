# ðŸ“– Attributes of Online Communication (In Depth)

Online communication is a defining feature of the digital era. Unlike

multidimensional**.\
Its attributes shape how information is produced, distributed, and
consumed in new media environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Interactivity

-   **Meaning:** Interactivity means the receiver can respond to the
    sender, creating two-way communication.\
